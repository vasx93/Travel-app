# Travel-app
This is a fullstack app made for booking travel tours which follows REST API schema and MVC pattern.
Tech stack used: Node.js, MongoDB & Mongoose, HTML/Pug, CSS.

Some key features include:
- CRUD Routes for users/tours/reviews/bookings
- Roles authentication,
- user accounts with option to change all info
- upload and resize middleware for user photos
- emails on sign up, delete acount and others
- deactivate/reactivate account via email token
- reset password via email token
- real-time updated reviews
- JWT can be stored both in local storage and in req.cookies
- fully working stripe payments processor

While building this app my focus was on improving my skills in handling user authentication, referencing and embedding models in MongoDB, app security and endpoints structure.
